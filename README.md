# SDL Game of Life
An implementation of Conway's game of life using Rust for backend and SDL2 for user interface.
## Features to be added:
- The ability to pause the universe.
- Increase the size of the world (possibly "infinite" size universe implementation).
- Implement GPU acceleration for rendering the cells.
- The ability to scroll through the universe.
- The ability to toggle a cell (Turn a dead cell into a live cell, and vice versa) by clicking on it.
- The ability to drag to draw new live cells.
- The ability to zoom in and out of the universe (Scaling the cells).
- Support other display sizes for the window.
- The ability to change resolution.
